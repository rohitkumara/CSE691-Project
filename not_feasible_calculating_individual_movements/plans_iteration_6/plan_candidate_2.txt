Okay, I understand the environment and the goal. Here's the plan for the agent to deliver the box to the goal:
Move to (3,6): Move one step east with the box.
Move to (5, 6): Move one step east.
Pick up the blue key.
Move to the blue door.
Toggle the blue door.
Move to (3,6): Move one step west.
Move to (3,1): Move one step west.
Pick up the box.
Move to (5,6): Move one step east.
Move to (7,5): Move to the goal.
Drop the box.
