Here are a few valid subtasks the agent could perform, given the current state and goal:
**Move to (3, 2)** (Move towards the right side of the environment, avoiding the walls and the green key)
**Move to (4, 1)** (Move towards the right side of the environment, avoiding the walls and the green key)
**Move to (3, 0)** (Move towards the right side of the environment, avoiding the walls and the green key)
**Move to (4, 2)** (Move towards the right side of the environment, avoiding the walls and the green key)
**Move to (4, 3)** (Move towards the right side of the environment, avoiding the walls and the green key)
These subtasks all involve moving the agent towards the goal while carrying the purple box. They are valid because they only use the "Move to" action and do not involve any illegal moves (e.g., moving through walls).
